# 🤝 Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **DevSynthetix First Contribution**! 🚀

This repository is special because it is **managed by an AI Bot**. To ensure your contribution is accepted and merged automatically, please follow the rules below carefully.

---

## 🚨 The Golden Rules (Read Carefully)

To pass the AI security checks, you must follow these 3 rules:

1.  **Edit ONE File Only:** You are only allowed to edit `contributors/README.md`.
    * ❌ Do not touch the main `README.md`.
    * ❌ Do not create new files or folders.
    * ❌ Do not change code in `.github/workflows`.
    * *Result:* If you touch other files, the Bot will **reject** your PR immediately.

2.  **Link Your Issue:** Your Pull Request description must contain the "Closes" keyword.
    * ✅ Correct: `Closes #12`
    * ❌ Incorrect: `Fixed issue 12`, `Done`, or empty description.

3.  **No Spam:** Do not create multiple PRs for the same issue. One valid contribution is enough to earn your spot!

## 🛠️ The Automated Workflow

Here is exactly how our system works. Follow these steps to get merged in minutes:

### 1. Get Assigned 🎟️
* Find an open **"Contribution Slot"** issue.
* Comment **`Assign me`**.
* The Bot will verify availability and assign the issue to you within seconds.

### 2. Make Your Change ✍️
* Fork the repo.
* Add your name to `contributors/README.md` in this format:
    ```markdown
    - [Your Name](https://github.com/your-username)
    ```

### 3. Submit PR & Auto-Merge 🤖
* Create a Pull Request.
* **IMPORTANT:** In the description box, write: `Closes #<your-issue-number>`.
* **Wait for the Bot:**
    1.  The Bot will run a **Security Check**.
    2.  It will verify **File Integrity**.
    3.  If everything is green, it will **Auto-Merge** your PR.
    4.  It will post a congratulatory message and close the issue.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: The Bot said "Manual Review Required". Why?**
**A:** You likely edited a file other than `contributors/README.md`. Close that PR, fix the file, and submit a new one.

**Q: My PR is open but not merging.**
**A:** Did you write `Closes #<number>` in the description? If not, edit the description to add it.

**Q: I see "Merge Conflict".**
**A:** Someone else was merged just before you. Update your branch (`git pull`) and try again.
