# 🤝 Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **DevSynthetix First Contribution**! 🚀

This repository is special because it is **managed by an AI Bot**. To ensure your contribution is accepted, please follow the rules below depending on which issue you claimed.

## 🚨 The Golden Rules (Read Carefully)

To pass the AI security checks, you must follow these 3 rules:

1.  **Edit the Correct File:** Only edit the file mentioned in your Issue Task.
    * ✅ **Auto-Merge Files:** `contributors/README.md` and `reviews/feedback.md`.
    * 👀 **Manual Review Files:** `README.md` (Main) - *These take longer to merge.*
    * ❌ **Strictly Forbidden:** Do not edit `.github/workflows` or create random files.

2.  **Link Your Issue:** Your Pull Request description must contain the "Closes" keyword.
    * ✅ Correct: `Closes #12`
    * ❌ Incorrect: `Fixed issue 12`, `Done`, or empty description.

3.  **No Spam:** Do not create multiple PRs for the same issue. One valid contribution is enough to earn your spot!

## 🛠️ The Automated Workflow

Here is exactly how our system works:

### 1. Get Assigned 🎟️
* Find an open **"Contribution Slot"** issue.
* Comment **`Assign me`**.
* The Bot will assign the issue to you within seconds.

### 2. Make Your Change ✍️
* **If you picked a "Name Slot":** Add your name to `contributors/README.md`.
* **If you picked "Community Review":** Write a review in `reviews/feedback.md`.
* **If you picked "Documentation":** Fix grammar in `README.md`.

### 3. Submit PR & Auto-Merge 🤖
* Create a Pull Request.
* **IMPORTANT:** In the description box, write: `Closes #<your-issue-number>`.
* **Wait for the Bot:**
    1.  The Bot will run a **Security Check**.
    2.  **If you edited Auto-Merge files:** It will merge instantly! 🚀
    3.  **If you edited Documentation:** It will wait for a human admin to approve. ⏳

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: The Bot said "Manual Review Required". Why?**
**A:** This is normal if you edited the main `README.md`. An admin will check your changes shortly.

**Q: The Bot rejected my PR.**
**A:** You likely edited a file that was not part of your assigned issue (e.g., editing workflows).

**Q: My PR is open but not merging.**
**A:** Did you write `Closes #<number>` in the description? If not, edit the description to add it.
